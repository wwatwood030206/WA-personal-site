<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a student, designer, and web developer, currently enrolled at Weber State University.
  Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in computer science, and am on track to finish in 2026.
</p>
<p>My mission is to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ through previously underutilized medium.
  I envision a world in which every Bible-belivieving church has the tools necessary to clearly
  and effectively share their message. </p>
